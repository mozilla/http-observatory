def scan(hostname: str, **kwargs):
    """Performs an Observatory scan.

    Args:
        hostname (str): domain name for host to be scanned. Must not include
            protocol (http://, https://) or port number (:80).

    Kwargs:
        http_port (int): port to scan for HTTP, instead of 80
        https_port (int): port to be scanned for HTTPS, instead of 443
        path (str): path to scan, instead of "/"
        verify (bool): whether to enable or disable certificate verification,
            enabled by default. This can allow tested sites to pass the HSTS
            tests, even with self-signed certificates.

        cookies (dict): Cookies sent to the system being scanned. Matches the
            requests cookie dict.
        headers (dict): HTTP headers sent to the system being scanned. Format
            matches the requests headers dict.

    Returns:
        A dict representing the analyze (scan) and getScanResults (test) API call.  Example:

        {
            'scan': {
